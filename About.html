        <h1>
            <center>KOLKATA</center>
        </h1>
        <p>Kolkata, Bengali Kalikata, formerly Calcutta, city, capital of West Bengal state, and former capital
            (1772–1911) of British India. It is one of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports. The city is
            centred on the east bank of the Hugli (Hooghly) River, once the main channel of the Ganges (Ganga) River,
            about 96 miles (154 km) upstream from the head of the Bay of Bengal; there the port city developed as a
            point of transshipment from water to land and from river to sea. A city of commerce, transport, and
            manufacture, Kolkata is the dominant urban centre of eastern India.The city former name, Calcutta, is an
            Anglicized version of the Bengali name Kalikata. According to some, Kalikata is derived from the Bengali
            word Kalikshetra, meaning “Ground of (the goddess) Kali.” Some say the city’s name derives from the location
            of its original settlement on the bank of a canal (khal). A third opinion traces it to the Bengali words for
            lime (calcium oxide; kali) and burnt shell (kata), since the area was noted for the manufacture of shell
            lime. In 2001 the government of West Bengal officially changed the name of the city to Kolkata. Area city,
            40 square miles (104 square km); urban agglom., 533 square miles (1,380 square km). Pop. (2011) 4,486,679;
            urban agglom., 14,057,991.</p>
        <h2>Character of the city</h2>
        <p>Fashioned by the colonial British in the manner of a grand European capital—yet now set in one of the poorest
            and most overpopulated regions of India—Kolkata has grown into a city of sharp contrasts and contradictions.
            Kolkata has had to assimilate strong European influences and overcome the limitations of its colonial legacy
            in order to find its own unique identity. In the process it created an amalgam of East and West that found
            its expression in the life and works of the 19th-century Bengali elite and its most noteworthy figure, the
            poet and mystic Rabindranath Tagore.This large and vibrant Indian city thrives amid seemingly insurmountable
            economic, social, and political problems. Its citizens exhibit a great joie de vivre that is demonstrated in
            a penchant for art and culture and a high level of intellectual vitality and political awareness. Crowds
            throng to Kolkata’s book fairs, art exhibitions, and concerts, and there is a lively trading of polemics on
            walls, which has led to Kolkata being dubbed the “city of posters.”Yet for all of Kolkata’s vitality, many
            of the city’s residents live in some of the worst conditions, far removed from the cultural milieu. The
            city’s energy nevertheless penetrates even to the poorest areas, as a large number of Kolkatans sincerely
            support the efforts of those who minister to the underprivileged. In short, Kolkata remains an enigma to
            many Indians as well as to foreigners. It continues to puzzle newcomers and to arouse an abiding nostalgia
            in the minds of those who have lived there.</p>
        <h2>Landscape</h2>
        <h3>City Site</h3>
        <p>The location of the city appears to have been originally selected partly because of its easily defensible
            position and partly because of its favourable trading location. The low, swampy, hot, and humid riverbank
            otherwise has little to recommend it. Its maximum elevation is about 30 feet (9 metres) above sea level.
            Eastward from the river the land slopes away to marshes and swamplands. Similar topography on the west bank
            of the river has confined the metropolitan area largely to a strip 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) wide on either
            bank of the river. Reclamation of the Salt Lake area on the northeastern fringe of the city, however,
            demonstrated that the spatial expansion of the city is feasible, and further reclamation projects have been
            undertaken to the east, south, and west of the central area.Suburbs of Kolkata include Haora (Howrah) on the
            west bank, Baranagar to the north, South Dum Dum to the northeast, Behala to the south, and Garden Reach in
            the southwest. The whole urban complex is held together by close socioeconomic ties.</p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>Kolkata has a subtropical climate with a seasonal regime of monsoons (rain-bearing winds). It is warm
            year-round, with average high temperatures ranging from about 80 °F (27 °C) in December and January to
            nearly 100 °F (38 °C) in April and May. The average annual rainfall is about 64 inches (1,625 mm). Most of
            this falls from June to September, the period of the monsoon. These months are very humid and sometimes
            sultry. During October and November the rainfall dwindles. The winter months, from about the end of November
            to the end of February, are pleasant and rainless; fogs and mists occasionally reduce visibility in the
            early morning hours at this season, as also do thick blankets of smog in the evenings. The atmospheric
            pollution has greatly increased since the early 1950s. Factories, motor vehicles, and thermal-generating
            stations, which burn coal, are primary causes of this pollution, but monsoon winds act as cleansing agents
            by bringing in fresh air masses and also hastening the removal of water pollution.</p>
        <h3>City Layout</h3>
        <p>The most striking aspect of the layout of Kolkata is its rectangular north-south orientation. With the
            exception of the central areas where Europeans formerly lived, the city has grown haphazardly. This
            haphazard development is most noticeable in the fringe areas around the central core formed by the city of
            Kolkata and the suburb of Haora. The bulk of the city’s administrative and commercial activity is
            concentrated in the Barabazar district, a small area north of the Maidan (the park containing Fort William
            and many of the city’s cultural and recreational facilities). The layout has encouraged the development of a
            pattern of daily commuting that has overburdened Kolkata’s transportation system, utilities, and other
            municipal facilities.Kolkata’s system of streets and roads reflects the city’s historical development. An
            express highway, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, stretches from Kolkata to Dum Dum, though most local streets are
            narrow. The main roads form a grid pattern primarily in the old European sector, but elsewhere road planning
            has a random character. Part of the reason for this has been the difficulty of providing enough river
            crossings; it is for the same reason that most streets and highways run from north to south. Nullahs
            (watercourses) and canals that require bridging also have been important factors in influencing the road
            pattern.</p>
        <h3>Housing</h3>
        <p>The city has an acute housing shortage. Of the persons living in institutional shelters in the Kolkata
            metropolitan area, more than two-thirds live in the city itself. About three-fourths of the housing units in
            the city are used for dwelling purposes only. There are thousands of urban settlements called bastis, where
            about one-third of the city’s population lives. A basti (also spelled busti or bustee) is officially defined
            as “a collection of huts standing on a plot of land of at least one-sixth of an acre.” There also are bastis
            built on less than one-sixth of an acre (one-fifteenth of a hectare). The majority of basti dwellings are
            tiny, unventilated, single-story rooms, often dilapidated. They have few sanitary facilities, and there is
            very little open space. The government has sponsored basti improvement and resettlement programs.</p>
        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>In contemporary Kolkata the skyline is broken in some areas by skyscrapers and tall multistory blocks. The
            cityscape has changed rapidly. The Chowringhee area in central Kolkata, once a row of palatial houses, has
            been given up to offices, hotels, and shops. In northern and central Kolkata, buildings are still mainly two
            or three stories high. In southern and south-central Kolkata, multistoried apartment buildings have become
            more common.Western influence is dominant in many of Kolkata’s architectural monuments, though Indian
            influences also are apparent. The Raj Bhavan (the state governor’s residence) is an imitation of Kedleston
            Hall in Derbyshire, England; the High Court resembles the Cloth Hall at Ypres, Belgium; the Town Hall is in
            Grecian style with a Doric-Hellenic portico; St. Paul’s Cathedral is of Indo-Gothic-style architecture; the
            Writers’ Building is of Gothic-style architecture with statuary on top; the Indian Museum is in an Italian
            style; and the General Post Office, with its majestic dome, has Corinthian columns. The beautiful column of
            the Shaheed Minar (Ochterlony Monument) is 165 feet (50 metres) high—its base is Egyptian, its column
            Syrian, and its cupola in the Turkish style. Victoria Memorial Hall represents an attempt to combine
            classical Western influence with Mughal architecture; the Nakhoda Mosque is modeled on the tomb of the
            Mughal emperor Akbar at Sikandra; the Birla Planetarium is based on the stupa (Buddhist reliquary) at
            Sanchi. The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, the most important example of postindependence
            construction, follows the style of ancient Hindu palace architecture in northwestern India.</p>
        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>About three-fourths of the population is Hindu. Muslims constitute the largest minority group, and there are
            some Christians, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. The dominant language is Bengali, but Urdu, Odia, Tamil,
            Punjabi, and other languages also are spoken. Kolkata is a cosmopolitan city: other than Indians, groups
            present include a variety of peoples from elsewhere in Asia (notably Bangladeshis and Chinese), Europeans,
            North Americans, and Australians. Kolkata was segregated under British rule, the Europeans living in the
            city centre and Indians living to the north and south. The pattern of segregation has continued in the
            modern city, although the distribution is now based on religious, linguistic, educational, and economic
            criteria. Shantytowns and low-income residential areas, however, exist side-by-side with more affluent
            areas.The density of population is extremely high, and overcrowding has reached virtually intolerable
            proportions in many sections of the city. Kolkata experienced a high rate of population growth for more than
            a century, and events such as the partitioning of Bengal in 1947 and warfare in Bangladesh in the early
            1970s precipitated massive population influxes. Large refugee colonies also have sprung up in the northern
            and southern suburbs. In addition, a great number of migrants from other states—mostly from neighbouring
            Bihar and Odisha and eastern Uttar Pradesh—have come to Kolkata in search of employment.</p>
        <h1>Economy of Kolkata</h1>
        <p>Kolkata’s position as one of India’s preeminent economic centres is rooted in its manufacturing industries,
            its financial and trade activities, and its role as a major port; it is also a major centre for printing,
            publishing, and newspaper circulation, as well as for recreation and entertainment. Among the products of
            Kolkata’s hinterland have been coal, iron, manganese, mica, petroleum, tea, and jute. Unemployment, however,
            has been a continuing and growing problem since the 1950s.</p>
        <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>Kolkata is the centre of India’s large jute-processing industry. The jute industry was established in the
            1870s, and mills now extend north and south of the city centre on both banks of the Hugli River. Engineering
            constitutes the city’s other major industry. In addition, city factories produce and distribute a variety of
            consumer goods—notably foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, and textiles—other light manufactures, and chemicals.
            Kolkata’s industries have been in a general decline since Indian independence in 1947. Major factors
            contributing to this decline have been the loss of the eastern part of Bengal at independence, an overall
            decline in Kolkata’s industrial productivity, and the lack of industrial diversification in the city.</p>
        <h2>Finance, trade, and other services</h2>
        <p>The Calcutta Stock Exchange plays an important part in the organized financial market of the country. Foreign
            banks also have a significant business base in Kolkata, although the city’s importance as an international
            banking centre has declined. In addition, coal mines, jute mills, and large-scale engineering industries are
            controlled from offices in the city. State and national chambers of commerce are based in Kolkata as
            well.The mercantile nature of the city’s economy is reflected in the fact that about two-fifths of the
            workers are employed in trade and commerce. Other important occupations include public-sector service in
            government departments, financial institutions, and medical and educational institutions. Private-sector
            services include the stock exchange, medical and educational services, legal services, accountancy and
            credit firms, and various utility services.</p>
        <h2>Transport</h2>
        <p>The condition of the surfaced roads in the city is poor, although the traffic load is heavy. The mass transit
            system features numerous trams and buses, some under government management and others run by private
            companies. In 1986 the first section of a subway system—the first in India—was opened in the city. By the
            early 21st century it was the primary means of commuting within the city, with almost two million commuters
            using it every day.The connection between Kolkata and its hinterland to the west depends upon several
            bridges over the Hugli—those linked to Haora and, farther north, the bridges at Bally and Naihati. The main
            Haora bridge, Rabindra Setu, carries multiple lanes of vehicular traffic and is one of the most heavily used
            bridges in the world. Two additional bridges between Kolkata and Haora, Vidyasagar Setu and Nivedita Setu,
            have eased traffic on the main bridge.The Grand Trunk Road, a national highway, is one of the oldest road
            routes in India. It runs through Haora to Pakistan and is the main route connecting the city with northern
            India. National highways also connect Kolkata with the west coast of India, the northern part of West
            Bengal, and the frontier with Bangladesh.Two railway terminals—Haora on the west bank and Sealdah on the
            east—serve the railway networks running north and south as well as those running east and west. Kolkata’s
            major air terminal, at Dum Dum, handles international and domestic flights.The Kolkata port lost its
            position as India’s preeminent cargo handler in the 1960s, but it and the port of Haldia (about 40 miles [65
            km] downstream) still account for a large portion of the country’s foreign exchange. The decline in traffic
            occurred partly because of problems encountered in dredging silt from the river and partly because of labour
            difficulties. Transport, storage, wholesaling, and retailing requirements for exports and imports are
            concentrated in Kolkata and Haora.</p>
        <h2>Administration</h2>
        <h3>Government of Kolkata</h3>
        <p>Government in the city proper is the responsibility of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation; the corporation’s
            council is composed of one elected representative from each of the city’s wards. The council members
            annually elect a mayor, a deputy mayor, and a number of committees to conduct the activities of the
            corporation. A commissioner, the executive head of the corporation, is responsible to its elected
            membership. The city is also a part of the Kolkata Metropolitan District, an entity created to oversee
            planning and development on a regional basis. This district includes a large rural hinterland around the
            urban centres.Because Kolkata is the capital of the state of West Bengal, the governor resides in the city
            in the historic Raj Bhavan. The state Legislative Assembly is located in the city, as is the Secretariat,
            housed in the Writers’ Building, with the state ministries in charge of various departments. The Kolkata
            High Court, exercising original jurisdiction over the city and appellate jurisdiction over West Bengal, is
            also located there. A number of national government institutions—including the National Library, the Indian
            Museum, and the Geological Survey of India—are in the city as well.</p>
        <h3>Municipal services</h3>
        <p>Filtered water is supplied from the main waterworks located outside the city at Palta, as well as from some
            200 major wells and 3,000 smaller ones. The Farakka Barrage (dam) on the Ganges, 240 miles (386 km) upriver
            from Kolkata, ensures a generally saline-free water supply for the city, but because existing water supplies
            are inadequate, salinity continues to be a problem during the dry months. In addition, unfiltered water,
            supplied daily for watering the city streets and for the fire brigade, is used by many residents for their
            daily needs. This circumstance was largely responsible for the former prevalence of cholera during the
            summer months, but chlorination of unfiltered water and cholera inoculation have reduced considerably the
            occurrence of the disease.Municipal Kolkata has several hundred miles of sewers and surface drains, but much
            of the city remains unsupplied with sewers. Accumulation of silt has narrowed many sewer channels. The
            system of removing garbage and of garbage dumping is also unsatisfactory.Kolkata is supplied with
            electricity by a variety of sources. There is still a gap, however, between generating capacity and
            potential demand, and temporary power interruptions occur on occasion.Administration of the Kolkata police
            force is vested in the city’s commissioner of police, as is direction of the suburban police force. The city
            is divided into a number of police precincts. The fire brigade has its headquarters in central Kolkata.</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of hospitals, private clinics, free dispensaries run by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and
            charitable trusts, and state-operated polyclinics serve the Kolkata region. The number of doctors per 1,000
            persons is greater in Kolkata than in most parts of the country, but their distribution is uneven; since the
            city is a medical centre for the northeastern region of India, its health-care facilities are always
            overcrowded. The Order of the Missionaries of Charity, an organization founded (1948) by Mother Teresa
            (recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize of 1979), cares for the blind, the elderly, the dying, and people
            afflicted with leprosy in the poorest sections of the city. There are several medical colleges, in addition
            to other medical research centres.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Education has long been a mark of higher social status in Kolkata. The city has been a centre of learning
            since the resurgence in Indian education that began in Bengal in the early 19th century. The first
            English-style school, the Hindu College (later called Presidency University), was founded in 1817.Primary
            education is supervised by the government of West Bengal and is free in schools run by the municipal
            corporation. A large number of children, however, attend recognized schools that are under private
            management. Most secondary schools are under the supervision of the state, but some are accredited through
            the national government.Kolkata has three major universities: the University of Calcutta, Jadavpur
            University, and Rabindra Bharati University. The University of Calcutta, founded in 1857, has more than 150
            affiliated colleges. Besides these colleges, university colleges of arts (humanities), commerce, law,
            medicine, science, and technology specialize in postgraduate teaching and research. Jadavpur University
            (1955) has faculties in the arts (humanities), science, and engineering. Although the university has a small
            number of colleges affiliated with it, its main focus is on graduate and postgraduate instruction on a
            single campus. Rabindra Bharati University (1962), founded in honour of Rabindranath Tagore, specializes in
            humanities and the fine arts (dance, drama, and music).Research institutions include the Indian Statistical
            Institute, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, the Bose Institute (natural science), and
            the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, which is a constituent college of the University of
            Calcutta.</p>
        <h2>Cultural Life</h2>
        <p>Kolkata is perhaps the most important cultural centre of India. The city is the birthplace of modern Indian
            literary and artistic thought and of Indian nationalism, and its citizens have made great efforts to
            preserve Indian culture and civilization. The blending of Eastern and Western cultural influences over the
            centuries has stimulated the creation of numerous and diverse organizations that contribute to Kolkata’s
            cultural life. In addition to the universities, these include the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Bengal
            Literary Society (Bangiya Sahitya Parishad), the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, the Academy of
            Fine Arts, the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, and the Maha Bodhi Society.</p>
        <h3>Museums and libraries</h3>
        <p>Greater Kolkata has dozens of museums, which cover a wide variety of fields. The Indian Museum, founded in
            1814, is the oldest in India; the archaeology and numismatic sections contain valuable collections. The
            exhibits at Victoria Memorial Hall trace Britain’s relations with India. The Asutosh Museum of Indian Art in
            the University of Calcutta has exhibits of the folk art of Bengal among its collections. Science City, a
            large science museum and entertainment complex, was among the first of its kind in Asia. Valuable library
            collections are to be found in the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Bengal Literary Society, and the
            University of Calcutta; the National Library is the largest in India and contains a fine collection of rare
            books and manuscripts.</p>
        <h3>The Arts</h3>
        <p>Kolkatans have long been active in literary and artistic pursuits. The city saw the dawn of the
            mid-19th-century literary movement that sparked a cultural renaissance throughout India. The best exponent
            of this movement was Rabindranath Tagore, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature of 1913, whose remarkable
            creativity in poetry, music, drama, and painting continues to enrich the cultural life of the city. Kolkata
            remains at the vanguard of artistic movements in the country, and several artists’ societies present annual
            shows.Kolkata is also a centre of traditional and contemporary music and dance. In 1934 Tagore inaugurated
            the first All-Bengal Music Conference in Kolkata. Since then, a number of classical Indian music conferences
            have been held every year. The home of many classical dancers, Kolkata was the location of Uday Shankar’s
            experiments at adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional dance forms. The school of dance,
            music, and drama founded by him has been in the city since 1965.Professional drama got its start in Kolkata
            in the 1870s, with the founding of the National Theatre (later replaced by the Minerva Theatre). Modern
            dramatic forms were pioneered in the city by such playwrights as Girish Chandra Ghosh and Dina Bandhu Mitra.
            Kolkata is still an important centre of professional and amateur theatre and of experimental drama. The city
            also has been a pioneering centre of motion-picture production in India. The avant-garde film directors
            Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen achieved international acclaim. There are scores of cinemas in the city, which
            regularly show films in English, Bengali, and Hindi.</p>
        <h3>Recreation</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of parks, squares, and open spaces are maintained by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. There is,
            however, very little open space in the overcrowded parts of the city. The Maidan, about 1,000 acres (400
            hectares) in area, is the best-known open space; the major football (soccer), cricket, and hockey fields are
            located there. Adjacent to the Maidan is one of the oldest cricket fields in the world, Ranji Stadium, in
            the Eden Gardens; Netaji Stadium, for indoor events, is also in the vicinity. The Salt Lake Stadium, built
            to the east of the city, can seat 100,000 spectators. There are racecourses and golf courses within the
            city, and rowing at the Lake Club and the Bengal Rowing Club is popular. The Zoological Gardens are spread
            over an area of some 40 acres (16 hectares). The Indian Botanic Garden in Haora, on the west bank, contains
            thousands of species of plants.</p>
        <h2>History of Kolkata</h2>
        <h4>The early Period</h4>
        <p>The name Kalikata was mentioned in the rent-roll of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) and also in
            the Manasa-mangal of the Bengali poet Bipradas (1495). The history of Kolkata as a British settlement, known
            to the British as Calcutta, dates from the establishment of a trading post there by Job Charnock, an agent
            of the English East India Company, in 1690.Charnock had previously had disputes with officials of the Mughal
            Empire at the river port of Hugli (Hooghly) and had been obliged to leave, after which he attempted
            unsuccessfully to establish himself at other places down the river. When the Mughal officials, not wishing
            to lose what they had gained from the English company’s commerce, permitted Charnock to return once more, he
            chose Calcutta as the seat of his operations. The site was apparently carefully selected, being protected by
            the Hugli (Hooghly) River on the west, a creek to the north, and salt lakes to the east. Rival Dutch,
            French, and other European settlements were higher up the river on the west bank, so that access from the
            sea was not threatened, as it was at the port of Hugli. The river at this point was also wide and deep; the
            only disadvantage was that the marshes to the east and swamps within the area made the spot unhealthy.
            Moreover, before the coming of the English, three local villages—Sutanati, Kalikata, and Gobindapore, which
            were later to become parts of Calcutta—had been chosen as places to settle by Indian merchants who had
            migrated from the silted-up port of Satgaon, farther upstream. The presence of these merchants may have been
            to some extent responsible for Charnock’s choice of the site.By 1696, when a rebellion broke out in the
            nearby district of Burdwan, the Mughal provincial administration had become friendly to the growing
            settlement. The servants of the company, who asked for permission to fortify their trading post, or factory,
            were given permission in general terms to defend themselves. The rebels were easily crushed by the Mughal
            government, but the settlers’ defensive structure of brick and mud remained and came to be known as Fort
            William. In 1698 the English obtained letters patent that granted them the privilege of purchasing the
            zamindari right (the right of revenue collection; in effect, the ownership) of the three villages. This area
            around Fort William—Calcutta—became the seat of the British province known as the Bengal Presidency.</p>
        <h3>Growth of the City</h3>
        <p>In 1717 the Mughal emperor Farrukh-Siyar granted the East India Company freedom of trade in return for a
            yearly payment of 3,000 rupees; this arrangement gave a great impetus to the growth of Calcutta. A large
            number of Indian merchants flocked to the city. The servants of the company, under the company’s flag,
            carried on a duty-free private trade. When the Marathas from the southwest began incursions against the
            Mughals in the western districts of Bengal in 1742, the English obtained permission from ʿAlī Vardī Khan,
            the nawab (ruler) of Bengal, to dig an entrenchment in the northern and eastern part of the town to form a
            moat on the land side. This came to be known as the Maratha Ditch. Although it was not completed to the
            southern end of the settlement, it marked the city’s eastern boundary.In 1756 the nawab’s successor, Sirāj
            al-Dawlah, captured the fort and sacked the town. A number of Europeans were imprisoned in a small lockup
            popularly known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and many died. Calcutta was recaptured in January 1757 by
            Robert Clive, one of the founders of British power in India, and by the British admiral Charles Watson. The
            nawab was defeated shortly afterward at Plassey (June 1757), after which British rule in Bengal was assured.
            Gobindapore was cleared of its forests, and the new Fort William was built on its present site, overlooking
            the Hugli at Calcutta, where it became the symbol of British military ascendancy.</p>
        <h2>Capital of British India</h2>
        <p>Calcutta did not become the capital of British India until 1772, when the first governor-general, Warren
            Hastings, transferred all important offices to the city from Murshidabad, the provincial Mughal capital. In
            1773 Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras (now Chennai) became subordinate to the government at Fort William. A
            supreme court administering English law began to exercise original jurisdiction over the city as far as the
            Maratha Ditch (now Acharya Prafulla Chandra and Jagadish Chandra Bose roads).In 1706 the population of
            Calcutta was roughly between 10,000 and 12,000. It increased to nearly 120,000 by 1752 and to 180,000 by
            1821. The White (British) Town was built on ground that had been raised and drained. There were so many
            palaces in the British sector of the city that it was named the “city of palaces.” Outside the British town
            were built the mansions of the newly rich, as well as clusters of huts. The names of different quarters of
            the city—such as Kumartuli (the potters’ district) and Sankaripara (the conch-shell workers’ district)—still
            indicate the various occupational castes of the people who became residents of the growing metropolis. Two
            distinct areas—one British, one Indian—came to coexist in Calcutta.Calcutta at that time was described as a
            pestilential town. There were few good roads. In 1814 the Lottery Committee was constituted to finance
            public improvement by means of lotteries, and between 1814 and 1836 it took some effective measures to
            improve conditions. The municipal corporation was established in 1841. Cyclones in 1864, 1867, and 1870,
            however, devastated the poorer, low-lying areas.By successive stages, as British power extended over the
            subcontinent, the whole of northern India became a hinterland for the port of Calcutta. The abolition of
            inland customs duties in 1835 created an open market, and the construction of railways (beginning in 1854)
            further quickened the development of business and industry. It was at this time that the Grand Trunk Road
            from Calcutta to Peshawar (now in Pakistan) was completed. British mercantile, banking, and insurance
            interests flourished. The Indian sector of Calcutta also became a busy hub of commerce and was thronged with
            people from throughout India and many other parts of Asia. Calcutta became the intellectual centre of the
            subcontinent.The turn of the 20th century marked the beginning of a troublesome period for Calcutta. Lord
            Curzon, viceroy of India, partitioned Bengal in 1905, making Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh.) the capital of
            eastern Bengal and Assam. Insistent agitation led to the annulment of this partition in 1911, but at that
            time the capital of British India was removed from Calcutta to Delhi, where the government could enjoy
            relative calm.Meanwhile, as Calcutta’s population grew larger, social problems also became more insistent,
            as did demands for home rule for India. Communal riots occurred in 1926, and, when the nationalist leader
            Mahatma Gandhi called for noncompliance with unjust laws, riots occurred in 1930. In World War II, Japanese
            air raids upon the Calcutta docks caused damage and loss of life. The most serious communal riots of all
            took place in 1946, when the partition of British India became imminent and tensions between Muslims and
            Hindus reached their height.</p>
        <h2>Capital of West Bengal</h2>
        <p>In 1947 the partition of Bengal between newly independent India and Pakistan constituted a serious setback
            for Calcutta, which became the capital of West Bengal only, losing the trade of a part of its former
            hinterland. At the same time, millions of refugees from the eastern portion of Bengal—which had become East
            Pakistan (now Bangladesh)—flocked to Calcutta, aggravating social problems and increasing overcrowding,
            which had already assumed serious proportions. Economic stagnation in the mid-1960s further increased the
            instability of the city’s social and political life and fueled a flight of capital from the city. The
            management of many companies was assumed by the state government.In the 1980s, large-scale public works
            programs and centralized regional planning contributed to the improvement of economic and social conditions
            in the city. Beginning in the 1990s, large-scale manufacturing companies were mostly replaced with
            small-scale assembly, commercial, and other service-sector business firms. However, militant trade unions
            slowed the introduction of new technology and deterred entrepreneurial activity and investment. In addition,
            despite the construction of a subway system—a welcome addition to the existing mass transit system—a rapid
            increase in the number of privately owned vehicles produced severe traffic congestion. The city was dealt a
            major blow in September 2000, when parts of it were inundated by floodwaters. The flooding left hundreds of
            people dead and tens of thousands homeless.In 2001 the city’s name was officially changed from Calcutta to
            Kolkata. Although Kolkata is not as economically dynamic as some of the other major Indian cities, it
            continues to be a cultural, artistic, literary, and intellectual centre.</p>
